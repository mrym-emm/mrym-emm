- 👋 Hi, I’m Maryam. Prepare for cringey 'about me!'
- 🌱 I’m just a simple human being trying to take things day by day
- 🌱 I like the saying of 'Nature doesn't rush, yet it accomplishes' (credit to Lao Tzu)
- 🌱 That being said I plan to sow my seeds, not so a tree would grow out of it, but because I enjoy gardening (obv not literally) :)
- 🐍 I'm currently learning Python and I'm just trying to enjoy the journey more than anything!
- 📫 How to reach me-> github username : @mrym-emm
