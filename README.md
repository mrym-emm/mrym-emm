- 👋 Hi, I’m Maryam.
- 🌱 I’m just a simple human being trying to learn things day by day
- 🌱 My life's motto is 'Nature doesn't rush, yet it accomplishes' (credit to Lao Tzu)
- 🌱 That being said I plan to sow my seeds, not so a tree would grow out of it, but because I enjoy gardening :)
- 🐍 I'm currently learning Python and I'm just trying to enjoy the journey more than anything!
